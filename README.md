# TIC-TAC-TOE-PROJECT
Project Description
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Python. It allows one player (you) to compete against the computer. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (X or O) in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent does. It’s a fun way to play and learn Python at the same time!
FEATURES
	•	A 3x3 grid displayed in a clear, readable format.
